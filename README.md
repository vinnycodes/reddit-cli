# Reddit CLI


Basic CLI to interact with Reddit.

This is a very simple CLI that pulls a random reddit post from reddit's home page by utilizing node and the reddit /.json

Strictly created as my first CLI to learn more about how Node works and creating ones own CLI. Enjoy. 

## Installation

This is meant to be ran locally so that is why we use the -g flag

```bash
npm install reddit -g
```
